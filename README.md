# Nuts2json

[Nuts2json](https://github.com/eurostat/Nuts2json) provides various reusable versions of [Eurostat NUTS dataset](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview) as web formats such as [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/). It is provided to support the development of statistical web maps of [Eurostat data](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/) based on NUTS regions. In a way, it provides a blank map of geometries ready for use with your own data and colors.

For a faster creation of maps based on Nuts2json, check out [**eurostat-map.js**](https://github.com/eurostat/eurostat.js/blob/master/doc/README-map.md).

See [some examples below](https://github.com/eurostat/Nuts2json#some-examples).

## API

Base URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/master/`

URL patterns:

- For TopoJSON format: `/<YEAR>/<PROJECTION>/<SCALE>/<NUTS_LEVEL>.json`
- For GeoJSON format: `/<YEAR>/<PROJECTION>/<SCALE>/<TYPE>[_<NUTS_LEVEL>].json`

For example, [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/master/2016/3035/20M/2.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/master/2016/3035/20M/2.json) returns a TopoJSON file of 2016 NUTS regions level 2 in European LAEA projection ([EPSG 3035](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/)) at 1:20M scale.

The parameters are:

| Parameter | Supported values | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| `YEAR` | `2016` `2013` `2010` | The NUTS version. |
| `PROJECTION` | `3035` `3857` `4258` `4326` | The coordinate reference system EPSG code. Two projections are provided: European LAEA projection ([EPSG 3035](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/)) and web mercator ([EPSG 3857](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/7483/)). For statistical maps, it is strongly adviced to use an equal-area projection such as `3035`. Geographic coordinates ETRS89 ([EPSG 4258](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4258/)) and WGS84 ([EPSG 4326](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/)) are also provided. |
| `SCALE` | `60M` `20M` `10M` | The intended map scale factor. The larger the value, the stronger the simplification. For example, for a map width of 1000 pixels the scale 1:20M is the most suitable. |
| `NUTS_LEVEL` | `0` `1` `2` `3` | The NUTS level to be displayed on the map, from national (NUTS_LEVEL=`0`) to local level (NUTS_LEVEL=`3`). |
| `TYPE` | `nutsrg` `nutsbn` `cntrg` `cntbn` `gra` | For GeoJSON format, the feature type has to be specified. The available feature types are described below. For NUTS feature types (`nutsrg` and `nutsbn`), the `NUTS_LEVEL` to be displayed on the map has to be specified.  |

For additional projections, formats, scales, etc., feel free to [ask](https://github.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/issues/new) !

### Feature types

Five feature types are provided:

- NUTS regions (feature type `nutsrg`) with the following properties:
  - `id`: The NUTS identifier to be used to join Eurostat statistical figures and then assign colors to the regions.
  - `na`: The geographical name of the region.

- NUTS boundaries (feature type `nutsbn`) with the following properties:
  - `lvl`: The NUTS level of the boundary, from 0 (national level) to 3 (provincial level).
  - `eu`: T if the boundary separate two EU member states, F otherwise.
  - `efta`: T if the boundary touches at least one EFTA country, F otherwise.
  - `cc`: T if the boundary touches at least one Candidate Country, F otherwise.
  - `oth`: T if the boundary touches a country wich is not EU, EFTA,CC. F otherwise.
  - `co`: T if the boundary is coastal. F otherwise.

- Non-european countries (feature type `cntrg`) with the following properties:
  - `id`: The country identifier (2 letters code).
  - `na`: The country name.

- Non-european boundaries (feature type `cntbn`) with the following properties:
  - `cc`: T if the boundary touches at least one Candidate Country, F otherwise.
  - `oth`: T if the boundary touches a country wich is not EU, EFTA,CC. F otherwise.
  - `co`: T if the boundary is coastal. F otherwise.

- The map graticule (meridian and parrallel lines) is provided as feature type `gra` with a single `id` property, which is the lat/lon of the parallel/meridian.

### NUTS regions as points

NUTS regions are also provided as point geometries. These points can be used for label placement or simplified maps such as [Dorling cartograms](http://www.dannydorling.org/wp-content/files/dannydorling_publication_id1448.pdf). Since this data does not depend on the `<SCALE>` parameter, it can be retrieved directly under the `/<YEAR>/<PROJECTION>/nutspt_<NUTS_LEVEL>.json` URL pattern, as GeoJSON format.

For example, [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/master/2013/4326/nutspt_2.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/master/2013/4326/nutspt_2.json) returns a GeoJSON file of 2013 NUTS points level 2 in WGS84 ([EPSG 4326](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/)) geographic coordinates.

The point features are provided with the following properties:
  - `id`: The NUTS identifier.
  - `na`: The geographical name of the region.
  - `ar`: The area of the region, in mÂ².

## Technical details

These files are produced from the NUTS SHP files provided on [Eurostat-GISCO website](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts). The input files are in the [shp folder](/shp).

These input files are transformed using [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki). The transformation process is automated in bash files, which are also shared in the [sh folder](/sh). This process has 6 successive steps:
1. *filter_project_clip*: Filter and reproject the input data for each year, each scale and each projection.
2. *extract_shp_by_level*: For each year, scale and projection, decompose the data by NUTS level.
3. *shp_to_geojson*: Convert from SHP to GeoJSON format.
4. *geojson_to_topojson*: Convert from GeoJSON to TopoJSON format.
5. *simplify_topojson*: Simplify the TopoJSON files using [TopoJSON Simplify](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-simplify/) program.
6. *topojson_to_geojson*: Convert from TopoJSON to GeoJSON format.

And finally:

9. *points*: Produces the NUTS regions as points.
